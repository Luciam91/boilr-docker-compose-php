## What is this?

Boilr is a tool for generating your projects boilerplate files. This template repository provides templates for generating docker-compose.yml for PHP projects.

These templates are configued based on MY personal opinion on how docker-compose works best for PHP, particularly Symfony, projects.

**These templates WILL get smarter when boilr advances**
